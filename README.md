📊 Customer Behavior Analysis | Power BI Project (Metrics-Driven Insights)

How can businesses increase revenue, improve customer experience, and optimize marketing spend?
I explored this through a Customer Behavior Analysis Dashboard built in Power BI, analyzing 4,000+ customers and their purchasing patterns.

🔹 Revenue Concentration Insight
• 68% of total revenue (158K) comes from male customers
• 32% (75K) from female customers
👉 Opportunity identified: targeted female-focused campaigns could diversify and grow revenue streams.

🔹 Spending & Satisfaction Metrics
• Average Purchase Value: 59.76
• Average Review Rating: 3.75 ⭐
👉 Indicates stable spending behavior with room to improve customer satisfaction through product & delivery optimization.

🔹 Product Performance Metrics
• Sandals alone drive ~15K purchases, highest among all items
• Top 5 items contribute the majority of purchase frequency
👉 Inventory and promotion strategy can prioritize high-velocity products to maximize ROI.

🔹 Logistics Impact on Revenue
• Customers choosing Express & 2-Day Shipping spend ~8–10% more than standard shipping users
👉 Faster delivery directly correlates with higher cart value, supporting premium shipping investments.

🔹 Discount Effectiveness Analysis
• Products with higher discount application (Sandals, Hats) also show higher purchase frequency
👉 Confirms discounts are a strong conversion lever when applied to the right products.

🔹 Subscription Revenue Opportunity
• 72% customers are non-subscribers (543 vs 202)
👉 Introducing targeted subscription incentives could significantly improve customer lifetime value (CLTV).

🔹 High-Value Demographics
• Young Adults & Middle-Aged customers contribute the highest total purchase amount
👉 Ideal segments for personalized offers and remarketing strategies.
